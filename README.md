# Code Retreat with Elm

Write your tests in `Tests.elm`.

Implementation can go straight in there, or create and import files as necessary...

## Get it working on your machine
1. Clone this repository

2. Install [Elm](http://elm-lang.org)
```bash
npm install -g elm elm-format
```

3. Install elm-test

Because elm-test isn't available as regular binary, you'll need Node and install it via NPM.
```bash
npm install -g elm-test@beta
```

4. Run tests
```bash
elm-test
```
Add the `--watch` flag if you want them to be run continuously.

GL HF!
